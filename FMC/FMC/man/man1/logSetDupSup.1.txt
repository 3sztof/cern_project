DESCRIPTION
       Set the Duplicate Suppression Settings of a FMC  Message Logger
       Message Logger Server.
       DIM Name Server can be chosen (in decreasing order of priority) by:
              1. Specifying the -N DIM_DNS_NODE command-line option;
              2. Specifying the DIM_DNS_NODE environment variable;
              3. Defining the DIM_DNS_NODE in the file "/etc/sysconfig/dim".

OPTIONS
       -h     Get basic usage help from the command line.
       -v     Increase output verbosity.
       -N DIM_DNS_NODE (string)
              Use DIM_DNS_NODE as DIM Name Server node.
       -m NODE_PATTERN (string, repeatable)
              Set suppression settings to loggers running on nodes whose
              hostname matches the wildcard pattern NODE_PATTERN
              (default: all the nodes).
       -s SERVICE_PATTERN (string, repeatable)
              Set suppression settings to loggers whose specific name
              matches the wildcard pattern SERVICE_PATTERN (default: all
              the logger). The specific name of the logger is the one set
              using -s option in logSrv command line. The specific name of
              the default logger is "logger".
       -E     Suppress repeated messages using exact comparison, i.e.
              suppress messages which are identical to at least one of the
              previous COMP_MSGS-1 messages. Default: do not suppress
              repeated messages. NB: the behaviour with this option is
              affected by -c, -C and -n options.
       -L LEV_DIST (integer)
              Suppress repeated messages using Levenshtein difference, i.e.
              suppress messages which differ less than or equal to LEV_DIST
              (inserted, deleted or substituted) characters from at least
              one of the previous COMP_MSGS-1 messages. Default: do not
              suppress repeated messages. NB: the behaviour with this
              option is affected by -c, -C and -n options.
       -W WORD_DIST (integer)
              Suppress repeated messages using word difference, i.e.
              suppress messages which differ less than or equal to
              WORD_DIST subsituted word, with respect to at least one of
              the previous COMP_MSGS-1 messages. Default: do not suppress
              repeated messages. NB: the behaviour with this option is
              affected by -c, -C and -n options.
       -n COMP_MSGS (integer)
              To suppress repeated messages, consider the last COMP_MSGS
              messages, i.e. compare each message with the previous
              COMP_MSGS-1 messages. Default: 1 if repeated message
              suppression is not active, 2 if it is active. NB: affect the
              behaviour with -E, -L and -W options.
       -c SKIP_NUM_COMP (integer)
              In the comparison for the repeated message suppression, skip
              SKIP_NUM_COMP characters in each string, i.e. start the
              comparison between a couple of string from the
              SKIP_NUM_COMP-th character. Affect the behaviour with -E, -L
              and -W options.
       -C SKIP_CHAR_COMP (string)
              In the comparison for the repeated message suppression, skip
              characters in each string until all the characters listed in
              the string SKIP_CHAR_COMP are passed. Affect the behaviour
              with -E, -L and -W options.

ENVIRONMENT:
       DIM_DNS_NODE (string, mandatory if not defined otherwise, see above)
              Host name of the node which is running the DIM DNS.
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH (string, mandatory if not set using ldconfig)
              Must include the path to the libraries "libdim.so"
              and "libFMCutils-2.so".

EXAMPLES
       Suppress messages which are identical to the previous one:
              logSetDupSup -E
       Suppress messages which are identical after the 30-th character
       to the previous one:
              logSetDupSup -E -c 30
       Suppress messages which are identical after the 30-th character
       to one of the previous 9 messages:
              logSetDupSup -E -c 30 -n 10
       Suppress messages which are identical, after the second ":" in
       the message, to one of the previous 9 messages:
              logSetDupSup -E -C "::" -n 10
       Suppress messages which differs, in at most 2 words after the
       second ":" with respect to one of the previous 9 messages:
              logSetDupSup -W 2 -C "::" -n 10
       Suppress messages which differs, in at most 6 character
       substituted, inserted or deleted after the second ":" with
       respect to one of the previous 9 messages:
              logSetDupSup -L 6 -C "::" -n 10
       Do not suppress repeated messages:
              logSetDupSup ""
