                       Monitor Servers

SYNOPSIS
       cpustatViewer [-N|--dim-dns DIM_DNS_NODE] [-v|--debug]
                     [-m|--hostname NODE_PATTERN...]
                     [-c|--compact [-H|--header]] [-s|--separate]
                     [-a|--all]

       cpustatViewer {-h,--help}

DESCRIPTION
       Get the context switch rate and the CPU states from the farm nodes
       whose hostname matches the wildcard pattern NODE_PATTERN, specified
       using the -m command line option. In addition to global node values,
       separate CPU values can be printed by means of --separate switch.
       Printed data are the context switch rates measured in Hz and the
       fraction of time spent by the CPUs performing different kinds of
       work:
              ctxt_rate
                     Total number of context switches per second across all
                     the CPUs.
              user   Time percentage the CPU has spent in normal processes
                     executing in user mode.
              system Time percentage the CPU has spent in normal processes
                     executing in kernel mode.
              nice   Time percentage the CPU has spent in niced processes
                     in user mode. Time spent in niced tasks will also be
                     counted in system and user time.
              idle   Time percentage the CPU has spent not working.
              iowait Time percentage the CPU has spent in waiting for I/O to
                     complete.
              irq    Time percentage the CPU has spent in servicing
                     interrupts (top halves). Available only with kernel
                     version >=2.5 (with previous kernel version this number
                     is set to zero).
              softirq
                     Time percentage the CPU has spent in servicing softirqs
                     (bottom halves). Available only with kernel version
                     >=2.5 (with previous kernel version this number is set
                     to zero).
       DIM Name Server can be chosen (in decreasing order of priority) by:
              1. Specifying the -N DIM_DNS_NODE command-line option;
              2. Specifying the DIM_DNS_NODE environment variable;
              3. Defining the DIM_DNS_NODE in the file "/etc/sysconfig/dim".

OPTIONS
       --help, -h
              Get basic usage help from the command line.
       --version, -V
              For each selected node print the FMC CPU state Monitor
              server version and sensor version, than exit.
       --dim-dns, -N DIM_DNS_NODE (string)
              Use DIM_DNS_NODE as DIM Name Server node.
       --debug, -v
              Increase verbosity for debugging.
       --hostname, -m NODE_PATTERN (string, repeatable)
              Get information from the nodes whose hostname matches the
              wildcard pattern NODE_PATTERN (default: get information from
              all the nodes).
       --compact, -c
              Print output in compact format (easier to parse).
       --header, -H
              Print a header for the compact format.
       --separate, -s
              Toggle the printout of the separate CPU states.
       --maximum, -M
              Toggle the printout of the maximum values.
       --all, -a
              Toggle all the optional (non-basic) fields. Equivalent to:
              "--separate".

ENVIRONMENT
       DIM_DNS_NODE (string, mandatory if not defined otherwise, see above)
              Host name of the node which is running the DIM DNS.
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH (string, mandatory if not set using ldconfig)
              Must include the path to the libraries "libdim"
              and "libFMCutils".

EXAMPLES
       Show the CPU states of all the farm nodes:
              cpustatViewer
       Show also average and maximum values:
              cpustatViewer -a
              cpustatViewer --all
       Print output in compact format with header:
              cpustatViewer -acH
              cpustatViewer -a -c -H
              cpustatViewer --all --compact --header
              cpustatViewer --al --co --hea
       Show also separate CPU states:
              cpustatViewer --separate
              cpustatViewer --se
              cpustatViewer -s
       Show only the CPU states of selected nodes:
              cpustatViewer -m farm0101 -m farm0102 --sep
       Show only the CPU states of wildcard-selected nodes:
              cpustatViewer -m "farm01*" -m "farm02*" --sep
              cpustatViewer -m "farm010[1357]" --all
       Show the server version installed on the farm nodes:
              cpustatViewer -V
              cpustatViewer --version
