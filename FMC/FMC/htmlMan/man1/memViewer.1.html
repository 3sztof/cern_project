<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Get  the  information  about  the  <B>memory</B> <B>usage</B> of the farm nodes whose
       hostname matches at least one of the  wildcard  patterns  <I>NODE</I><B>_</B><I>PATTERN</I>,
       specified  using  the <B>-m</B> <I>NODE</I><B>_</B><I>PATTERN</I> command line option (<B>default</B>: all
       the nodes registered with the DIM name server <I>DIM</I><B>_</B><I>DNS</I><B>_</B><I>NODE</I>).

       The data about total, used and free memory  are  partitioned  into  low
       memory and high memory. The <B>high</B> <B>memory</B> is all the memory above 896 MiB
       of physical memory. The high memory areas can be used by the user-space
       programs,  or  for the page-cache (but not for kernel data structures).
       The kernel must use some tricks to access the high memory (it temporar-
       ily  maps pages from high memory into the lower page tables), making it
       slower to access than low memory. The <B>low</B> <B>memory</B>, on the other side, is
       memory  which  can  be used for everything that high memory can be used
       for, but it is also available for the kernel's use  for  its  own  data
       structures  (e.g. kernel slabs). The kernel cannot work if it is out of
       low memory.

       Datum <B>Committed_AS</B> refers to the Linux  kernel  memory  <B>over-committing</B>
       policy.  When  a  process  dynamically allocate memory calling the <B>mal-</B>
       <B><A HREF="../../htmlMan/man3/loc.3.html">loc(3)</A></B> library call, and hence the <B><A HREF="../../htmlMan/man2/brk.2.html">brk(2)</A></B> system call, nothing happens,
       really. Only when the process start using the memory allocated with the
       <B><A HREF="../../htmlMan/man2/brk.2.html">brk(2)</A></B>, it get real memory, and just as much it uses. The hope is  that
       programs  ask for more than they actually need or that not all the run-
       ning programs need the memory they have demanded  with  <B><A HREF="../../htmlMan/man2/brk.2.html">brk(2)</A></B>  at  the
       same  time.  If the hope is fulfilled, the kernel can run more programs
       in the same memory space, or can run a program that requires more  vir-
       tual memory than is available. If the hope is not fulfilled, an <B>out-of-</B>
       <B>memory</B> (<B>OOM</B>) condition occurs: as a  consequence,  the  <B>OOM</B>  <B>killer</B>  is
       invoked  to  choose a process (following certain criteria) and kill it.
       Since kernel version 2.5.30 the over-committing behavior is  controlled
       by the two user-settable parameters in /proc/sys/vm/: <B>overcommit_memory</B>
       and <B>overcommit_ratio</B>. Since kernel 2.5.30 the parameter <B>overcommit_mem-</B>
       <B>ory</B> can be set to three different values:

              0:     heuristic over-commit handling (default);

              1:     never refuse any <B><A HREF="../../htmlMan/man2/brk.2.html">brk(2)</A></B>;

              2:     strict  over-commit. Never commit a virtual address space
                     larger than swap space plus a  fraction  <B>overcommit_ratio</B>
                     (default 50%) of the physical memory.

       Previous kernel allowed only values 0 and 1 for <B>overcommit_memory</B>.

       Data with <B>Vmalloc</B> prefix concern a mechanism to map physically non-con-
       tiguous memory areas to a contiguous area in virtual memory.  The  size
       of  this  region  will be always at least <I>VMALLOC</I><B>_</B><I>RESERVE</I>, which on the
       x86 is 128 MiB, located between <I>VMALLOC</I><B>_</B><I>START</I> and <I>VMALLOC</I><B>_</B><I>END</I> addresses
       in  virtual memory. The page tables in this region are adjusted as nec-
       essary to point to physical pages which are allocated with  the  normal
       physical  page allocator. Since allocations require altering the kernel
       page tables, there is a limitation on how much  memory  can  be  mapped
       with  <B>vmalloc</B>()  as  only  the  virtual  addresses  space between <I>VMAL-</I>
       <I>LOC</I><B>_</B><I>START</I> and <I>VMALLOC</I><B>_</B><I>END</I> is available. Usually, it is  only  used  for
       storing  the  swap  map information and for loading kernel modules into
       memory.

       The DIM Name Server <I>DIM</I><B>_</B><I>DNS</I><B>_</B><I>NODE</I>, looked up to seek for FMC CPU  Infor-
       mation Servers, can be chosen (in decreasing order of priority) by:

              1.     Specifying the <B>-N</B> <I>DIM</I><B>_</B><I>DNS</I><B>_</B><I>NODE</I> command-line option;

              2.     Specifying the <I>DIM</I><B>_</B><I>DNS</I><B>_</B><I>NODE</I> <B>environment</B> <B>variable</B>;

              3.     Defining  the  <I>DIM</I><B>_</B><I>DNS</I><B>_</B><I>NODE</I>  in  the  file  "<B>/etc/syscon-</B>
                     <B>fig/dim</B>".

       Retrieved parameters depend on the kernel version. They are a subset of
       the following:

              <B>Active</B> (uint64_t)
                     Amount  of  memory  that  has been used more recently and
                     usually not reclaimed unless absolutely necessary.

              <B>ActiveAnon</B> (uint64_t)
                     Amount  of  program  memory  that  has  been  used   more
                     recently. Specific of Linux kernel 2.4.

              <B>ActiveCache</B> (uint64_t)
                     Amount  of cache memory that has been used more recently.
                     Specific of Linux kernel 2.4.

              <B>AnonPages</B> (uint64_t)
                     Non-file backed pages mapped into userspace page  tables.

              <B>Bounce</B> (uint64_t)
                     Memory used for block device "bounce buffers".

              <B>Buffers</B> (uint64_t)
                     Relatively   temporary   storage   for  raw  disk  blocks
                     shouldn't get tremendously large (20MB or so).

              <B>Cached</B> (uint64_t)
                     In-memory cache for files read from the disk  (the  page-
                     cache). Doesn't include SwapCached.

              <B>CommitLimit</B> (uint64_t)
                     Based  on  the  overcommit ratio ('vm.overcommit_ratio'),
                     this is the total amount of memory currently available to
                     be allocated on the system. This limit is only adhered to
                     if strict overcommit accounting is  enabled  (mode  2  in
                     'vm.overcommit_memory').  The  CommitLimit  is calculated
                     with the following formula: CommitLimit  =  ('vm.overcom-
                     mit_ratio' * Physical RAM) + Swap. For example, on a sys-
                     tem with 1 GiB of physical RAM and 7 GiB of swap  with  a
                     'vm.overcommit_ratio'  of 30 it would yield a CommitLimit
                     of 7.3 GiB.

              <B>Committed_AS</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of memory presently allocated on  the  system.
                     The  committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which
                     has been allocated by processes, even if it has not  been
                     "used"  by  them  as of yet. A process which malloc()'s 1
                     GiB of memory, but only touches 300 MiB of it  will  only
                     show  up  as  using  300 MiB of memory even if it has the
                     address space allocated for the entire 1 GiB. This 1  GiB
                     is memory which has been "committed" to by the VM and can
                     be used at any time by the allocating  application.  With
                     strict  overcommit  enabled  on  the  system  (mode  2 in
                     'vm.overcommit_memory'), allocations which  would  exceed
                     the  CommitLimit  (detailed above) will not be permitted.
                     This is useful if one needs to guarantee  that  processes
                     will  not fail due to lack of memory once that memory has
                     been successfully allocated.

              <B>Dirty</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of memory which is waiting to get written back
                     to the disk.

              <B>HighFree</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of High Memory free. High memory is all memory
                     above ~860 MiB of physical memory. High memory areas  are
                     for  use by userspace programs, or for the pagecache. The
                     kernel must use tricks to access this memory,  making  it
                     slower to access than lowmem.

              <B>HighTotal</B> (uint64_t)
                     The  total amount of High Memory. High memory is all mem-
                     ory above ~860 MiB of physical memory. High memory  areas
                     are  for use by userspace programs, or for the pagecache.
                     The kernel must use tricks to access this memory,  making
                     it slower to access than lowmem.

              <B>HugePages_Free</B> (uint64_t)
                     The  number  of the Linux Huge Pages in the pool that are
                     not yet allocated. Hugepages is a mechanism  that  allows
                     the  Linux kernel to utilize the multiple page size capa-
                     bilities  of  modern  hardware  architectures,  by  using
                     "Transaction  Lookaside  Buffers" (TLB) in the CPU archi-
                     tecture. The default page size is 4 KiB in the x86 archi-
                     tecture,  while the Huge Page Size is typically 2048 KiB.

              <B>HugePages_Rsvd</B> (uint64_t)
                     The number of huge pages for which a commitment to  allo-
                     cate  from  the pool has been made, but no allocation has
                     yet been made. Reserved  huge  pages  guarantee  that  an
                     application will be able to allocate a huge page from the
                     pool of huge pages at fault time. Hugepages is  a  mecha-
                     nism that allows the Linux kernel to utilize the multiple
                     page size capabilities of modern hardware  architectures,
                     by using "Transaction Lookaside Buffers" (TLB) in the CPU
                     architecture. The default page size is 4 KiB in  the  x86
                     architecture,  while the Huge Page Size is typically 2048
                     KiB.

              <B>HugePages_Total</B> (uint64_t)
                     The size of the pool of huge pages. Hugepages is a mecha-
                     nism that allows the Linux kernel to utilize the multiple
                     page size capabilities of modern hardware  architectures,
                     by using "Transaction Lookaside Buffers" (TLB) in the CPU
                     architecture. The default page size is 4 KiB in  the  x86
                     architecture,  while the Huge Page Size is typically 2048
                     KiB.

              <B>Hugepagesize</B> (uint64_t)
                     The size of a Linux Huge Page. Hugepages is  a  mechanism
                     that allows the Linux kernel to utilize the multiple page
                     size capabilities of modern  hardware  architectures,  by
                     using  "Transaction  Lookaside  Buffers" (TLB) in the CPU
                     architecture. The default page size is 4 KiB in  the  x86
                     architecture,  while the Huge Page Size is typically 2048
                     KiB.

              <B>Inact_clean</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of memory which has been  less  recently  used
                     and  has  been already copied to the swap device. Because
                     clean pages are  already  synchronized  with  respect  to
                     their  backing  store, the OS can reuse Inact_clean pages
                     without having to write the page to a swap  device.  Spe-
                     cific of kernel 2.4.

              <B>Inact_dirty</B> (uint64_t)
                     The  amount  of  memory which has been less recently used
                     and has not yet been copied to the swap device. When mem-
                     ory  is  required,  the  OS  chooses to steal Inact_clean
                     pages before swapping Inact_dirty pages. Specific of ker-
                     nel 2.4.

              <B>Inact_laundry</B> (uint64_t)
                     The  amount  of  memory which has been less recently used
                     and which is being copied to the swap device. Specific of
                     kernel 2.4.

              <B>Inact_target</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of memory which OS ought to have, to be possi-
                     bly reclaimed for other purposes, calculated as  the  sum
                     of  Active,  Inact_dirty,  and  Inact_clean divided by 5.
                     When exceeded, the kernel will not do work to move  pages
                     from  active  to  inactive.  This is an indicator of when
                     page cleaning should be  performed.  Specific  of  kernel
                     2.4.

              <B>Inactive</B> (uint64_t)
                     The  amount  of memory which has been less recently used.
                     It is more eligible to be reclaimed for  other  purposes.
                     Since kernel 2.5.41+. In kernel 2.4 this value is the sum
                     Inact_dirty + Inact_laundry + Inact_clean.

              <B>LowFree</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of low memory free. Low memory is memory which
                     can  be  used for everything that high memory can be used
                     for, but it is also available for the  kernel's  use  for
                     its  own  data structures. Among many other things, it is
                     where everything from the Slab is allocated.  Bad  things
                     happen when you're out of low memory.

              <B>LowTotal</B> (uint64_t)
                     The  total  amount  of  low  memory. Low memory is memory
                     which can be used for everything that high memory can  be
                     used  for,  but it is also available for the kernel's use
                     for its own data structures. Among many other things,  it
                     is  where  everything  from  the  Slab  is allocated. Bad
                     things happen when you're out of low memory.

              <B>LowUsed</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of low memory used. Low memory is memory which
                     can  be  used for everything that high memory can be used
                     for, but it is also available for the  kernel's  use  for
                     its  own  data structures. Among many other things, it is
                     where everything from the Slab is allocated.  Bad  things
                     happen when you're out of low memory.

              <B>Mapped</B> (uint64_t)
                     The  amount of memory used to store files which have been
                     mmapped, such as libraries. Since kernel 2.5.41+..

              <B>MemFree</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of free memory (The sum  of  LowFree  +  High-
                     Free).

              <B>MemShared</B> (uint64_t)
                     The  amount  of  memory  shared between processes. Set to
                     zero since kernel 2.4.

              <B>MemTotal</B> (uint64_t)
                     The total usable ram  (i.e.  physical  ram  minus  a  few
                     reserved  bits  and the kernel binary code). = LowTotal +
                     HighTotal.

              <B>MemUsed</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of used memory (The difference MemTotal - Mem-
                     Free).

              <B>NFS_Unstable</B> (uint64_t)
                     NFS  pages  sent  to the server, but not yet committed to
                     stable storage.

              <B>PageTables</B> (uint64_t)
                     Amount of memory dedicated to the lowest  level  of  page
                     tables.

              <B>ReverseMaps</B> (uint64_t)
                     The number of reverse mappings performed.

              <B>SReclaimable</B> (uint64_t)
                     Part of Slab, that might be reclaimed, such as caches.

              <B>SUnreclaim</B> (uint64_t)
                     Part  of  Slab,  that cannot be reclaimed on memory pres-
                     sure.

              <B>Slab</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of memory used for in-kernel  data  structures
                     cache. Since kernel 2.5.41+.

              <B>SwapCached</B> (uint64_t)
                     Amount  of  memory  that once was swapped out, is swapped
                     back in but still also is in the swapfile (if  memory  is
                     needed it doesn't need to be swapped out AGAIN because it
                     is already in the swapfile. This saves I/O).

              <B>SwapFree</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of swap memory  free.  Swap  space  is  memory

                     the disk.

              <B>SwapTotal</B> (uint64_t)
                     The total amount of physical swap space  available.  Swap
                     space  is  memory which has been evicted from RAM, and is
                     temporarily on the disk.

              <B>SwapUsed</B> (uint64_t)
                     The amount of swap space used. Swap space is memory which
                     has  been  evicted  from  RAM,  and is temporarily on the
                     disk.

              <B>VmallocChunk</B> (uint64_t)
                     Largest contiguous block of vmalloc area which  is  free.
                     Vmalloc area is a memory area which is seen by the kernel
                     as a contiguous range of addresses in the virtual address
                     space, although the pages are not consecutive in physical
                     memory.

              <B>VmallocTotal</B> (uint64_t)
                     Total size of vmalloc memory area. Vmalloc area is a mem-
                     ory  area  which  is  seen  by the kernel as a contiguous
                     range of addresses in the virtual address space, although
                     the pages are not consecutive in physical memory.

              <B>VmallocUsed</B> (uint64_t)
                     Amount of vmalloc memory area which is used. Vmalloc area
                     is a memory area which is seen by the kernel  as  a  con-
                     tiguous  range of addresses in the virtual address space,
                     although the pages are not consecutive in  physical  mem-
                     ory.

              <B>Writeback</B> (uint64_t)
                     Amount  of memory which is actively being written back to
                     the disk.

              <B>WritebackTmp</B> (uint64_t)
                     Memory used by FUSE for temporary writeback buffers.
