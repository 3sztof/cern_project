<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FMC Process Monitor Server, <B><A HREF="../../htmlMan/man8/psSrv.8.html">psSrv(8)</A></B> retrieves information concern-
       ing  the processes and tasks (lighweight processes) running on the cur-
       rent farm node and publishes them using DIM.

       The DIM Name Server, looked up by <B>psSrv</B> to register  the  provided  DIM
       services, can be chosen (in decreasing order of priority) by:

              1. Specifying the <B>-N</B> <I>DIM</I><B>_</B><I>DNS</I><B>_</B><I>NODE</I> command-line option;

              2. Specifying the <I>DIM</I><B>_</B><I>DNS</I><B>_</B><I>NODE</I> <B>environment</B> <B>variable</B>;

              3. Defining the <I>DIM</I><B>_</B><I>DNS</I><B>_</B><I>NODE</I> in the file <B>/etc/sysconfig/dim</B>.

       <B>-d</B>     Set verbosity to maximum for debugging. More detailed control on
              diagnostic verbosity can be achieved by means of the <I>deBug</I> envi-
              ronment  variable  (see  below).  Option  <B>-d</B>  is  equivalent  to
              <I>deBug=0x7ff</I>.

              <I>OR</I> of the following logger units:

              0x1    the default FMC Message Logger (fifo: /tmp/logSrv.fifo);

              0x2    the standard error stream;

              0x4    the operating system syslog facility.

              <B>Default</B>: <I>LOGGER</I> = 0x1.

       <B>-u</B> <I>REFRESH</I><B>_</B><I>TIME</I><B>_</B><I>INTERVAL</I> <I>(integer)</I>
              Set the data refresh period  to  <I>REFRESH</I><B>_</B><I>TIME</I><B>_</B><I>INTERVAL</I>  seconds.
              (must be in the range [0,60]s). <B>Default</B>: 20 s.

       <B>-p</B> <I>PERSISTENCE</I> <I>(integer)</I>
              Keep  alive  the  on-demand  process  monitor  DIM services (see
              below) referring to terminated processes for <I>PERSISTENCE</I> service
              updates after process termination. <B>Default</B>: <I>PERSISTENCE</I> = 6.

       <B>-C</B> <I>CMD</I><B>_</B><I>PATTERN</I> <I>(string)</I>
              Publish  only  processes  whose command (executable image name),
              cut at 15 characters, matches the wildcard pattern  <I>CMD</I><B>_</B><I>PATTERN</I>.

       <B>-U</B> <I>UTGID</I><B>_</B><I>PATTERN</I> <I>(string)</I>
              Publish  only processes which have the UTGID set and whose UTGID
              matches the wildcard pattern <I>UTGID</I><B>_</B><I>PATTERN</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>

              UTGID of the <B><A HREF="../../htmlMan/man8/psSrv.8.html">psSrv(8)</A></B> process.

       <B>deBug</B> (integer, optional)
              Debug mask. Can be set to 0x000...0x7ff. The meaning of the mask
              bit are:

              0x001 print in/out functions;
              0x002 print file2strvec()/file2str() diagnostics;
              0x004 print getTasks() diagnosttics;

</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       Start the FMC Process Monitor Server, sending  diagnostic  messages  to
       the default FMC Message Logger:

       <I>bash$</I> <B>/opt/FMC/sbin/psSrv</B>

       Start  the  FMC  Process Monitor Server, sending diagnostic messages to
       the default FMC Message Logger and to the system syslog facility:

       <I>bash$</I> <B>/opt/FMC/sbin/psSrv</B> <B>-l</B> <B>0x5</B>

       Set the delay time interval between two subsequent refresh to four sec-
       onds:

       <I>bash$</I> <B>/opt/FMC/sbin/psSrv</B> <B>-u</B> <B>4</B>

       Publish only processes/tasks having the executable image name terminat-
       ing with "Srv":

       <I>bash$</I> <B>/opt/FMC/sbin/psSrv</B> <B>-C</B> <B>\*Srv</B>

       Publish  only  processes/tasks  having   the   UTGID   "counter_7"   or
       "counter_8":

       <I>bash$</I> <B>/opt/FMC/sbin/psSrv</B> <B>-U</B> <B>"counter_[78]"</B>

       Keep  active  the  dynamical DIM service related to a certain monitored
       process until the 10th refresh after the process termination:

       <I>bash$</I> <B>/opt/FMC/sbin/psSrv</B> <B>-p</B> <B>10</B>

              Publishes the summary data, for each process that was running at
              the time of the last server refresh. The first 11 strings  refer
              to the process with the lowest TGID, the following 11 string re-
              fer to the next process in TGID order, and so on. The string se-
              quence, for each process, is the following:

              <B>TGID</B> (alias PID)
                     Thread  Group Identifier (the former PID, Process Identi-
                     fier). The term <B>process</B> is synonymous of <B>thread</B> <B>group</B>.

              <B>UTGID</B>  FMC User-assigned  unique  Thread  Group  Identifier,  if
                     available  (e.g.  if  the process has been started by the
                     FMC Task Manager or has the variable UTGID defined in the
                     process environment). Otherwise "N/A" is published.

              <B>USER</B> (alias EUSER, UNAME)
                     <B>Effective</B>  user  name.  Used for all the security checks.
                     The only user name of the process that normally  has  any
                     effect.

              <B>VSIZE</B> (alias VSZ, VIRT)
                     The  total  size  of the process's memory footprint. This
                     includes the text segment, stack, static variables,  data
                     segment, and pages which are shared with other processes.

              <B>RSS</B> (alias RSZ, RES, RESIDENT)
                     The kernel's estimate of the resident set size  for  this
                     process.

              <B>STAT</B>   The multi-characters process state of the task. The mean-
                     ing of the first character is:

                      <B>D</B>      Uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O);

                      <B>R</B>      Running or runnable (on run queue);

                      <B>S</B>      Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to com-
                             plete);

                      <B>T</B>      Stopped,  either  by  a job control signal or be-
                             cause it is being traced;

                      <B>X</B>      Dead (should never be seen);

                      <B>Z</B>      Defunct ("zombie") process,  terminated  but  not
                             reaped by its parent.

                     The meaning of the following characters is:

                      <B>&lt;</B>      Higher-priority (not nice to other users);

                      <B>N</B>      Lower-priority (nice to other users);

                      <B>L</B>      Has  pages  locked into memory (for real-time and
                             custom I/O);

                      <B>s</B>      Is a session leader;

                      <B>l</B>      Is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like  NPTL
                             pthreads does);

                      <B>+</B>      Is in the foreground process group.

              <B>%CPU</B> (alias PCPU, CP, C)
                     The  task's  share of the CPU time since the last update,
                     expressed as a percentage of the total CPU time per  pro-
                     cessor. <B>Maximum</B>: 100% x CPU_core_number.

              <B>%MEM</B> (alias PMEM)
                     The ratio of the process's resident set size to the phys-
                     ical memory on the machine, expressed  as  a  percentage.
                     <B>Maximum</B>: 100%.

              <B>STARTED</B> (alias STARTTIME, START)
                     The process's start time.

              <B>CMD</B> (alias COMM, COMMAND, UCMD, UCOMM)
                     Command  name,  i.e.  the basename (w/o path) of the exe-
                     cutable image file, without arguments,  eventually  trun-
                     cated at 15 characters.

              <B>CMDLINE</B> (alias ARGS, CMD, COMMAND)
                     The  complete  command  line  with  its  arguments (up to
                     PATH_MAX = 4096  characters).  This  string  may  contain
                     blank characters.

              <B>Output</B> <B>format</B>: "C" (a sequence of 44 *  nprocs  NULL-terminated-
              strings).
              Publishes  the  detailed  data, for each <B>process</B> (<B>task</B>) that was
              running at the time of the last server  refresh.  The  first  44
              strings refer to the process with the lowest TGID, the following
              44 string refer to the next process in TGID order,  and  so  on.
              The string sequence, for each process, is the following:

              <B>CMD</B> (alias COMM, COMMAND, UCMD, UCOMM)
                     Command  name,  i.e.  the basename (w/o path) of the exe-
                     cutable image file, without arguments,  eventually  trun-
                     cated at 15 characters.

              <B>UTGID</B>  FMC  User-assigned  unique  Thread  Group  Identifier, if
                     available (e.g. if the process has been  started  by  the
                     FMC Task Manager or has the variable UTGID defined in the
                     process environment). Otherwise "N/A" is published.

              <B>TID</B> (alias LWP, SPID)
                     Thread Identifier, aka Light Weight  Process  Identifier.
                     The  <B>TID</B>  of the thread group leader is equal to the <B>TGID</B>
                     (Thread Group Identifier, the old <B>PID</B>). In  ".../process-
                     es/..."  SVC (as opposite to ".../tasks/..." SVC) <B>TID</B> al-
                     ways coincide with <B>TGID</B> (<B>PID</B>).

              <B>USER</B> (alias EUSER, UNAME)
                     <B>Effective</B> user name. Used for all  the  security  checks.
                     The  only  user name of the process that normally has any
                     effect.

              <B>TTY</B> (alias TT, TNAME)
                     The name of the controlling tty (terminal) if  available,
                     a question mark (<B>?</B>) otherwise.

              <B>NLWP</B> (alias THCNT)
                     Number  of Lightweight Processes (Threads) in the process
                     (thread group).

              <B>TGID</B> (alias PID)
                     Thread Group Identifier (the former PID, Process  Identi-
                     fier). The term <B>process</B> is synonymous of <B>thread</B> <B>group</B>.

              <B>PPID</B>   Parent  Process Identifier, i.e. the Thread Group Identi-
                     fier of the parent process.

              <B>PGID</B> (alias PGRP)
                     Process Group Identifierr, i.e. the Thread Group  Identi-
                     fier of the process group leader. Every process is member
                     of a unique process group. The processes of one  pipeline
                     form  a single process group. Among the process groups in
                     a session, at most one  can  be  the  <B>foreground</B>  <B>process</B>
                     <B>group</B>  of  that  session. The tty (teminal) input and tty
                     signals (signals generated by Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z, etc.) go to
                     processes  in  this foreground process group. All process
                     groups in a session that are not foreground process group
                     are <B>background</B> <B>process</B> <B>groups</B>.

              <B>SID</B> (alias SESS, SESSION)
                     Session  Identifier,  i.e. the Thread Group Identifier of
                     the session leader. Every process group is  in  a  unique
                     session. Every session may have a controlling tty (termi-
                     nal), that is also the controlling tty of each one of its
                     member  processes.  A  session is often set up by a login
                     process.

              <B>TPGID</B>  Terminal Process Group Identifier, i.e. the Process Group
                     Identifier  of  the  process which currently owns the tty
                     (terminal) that the process is connected to, or -1 if the
                     process is not connected to a tty.

                     cess. Can be set to any of the current  effective,  saved
                     or  real  user  names. Processes with "root" as effective
                     user name can set their filesystem access user name to an
                     arbitrary  value.  Used,  e.g., by the Linux's user-space
                     NFS server.

              <B>RUSER</B>  <B>Real</B> user name. Checked only when a process  attempts  to
                     change  its  effective  user name. Any process may change
                     its effective user name to the same value as  either  its
                     saved  or  real  user name. Only processes with "root" as
                     effective user name may change their effective user  name

                     saved  or  real  user name. Only processes with "root" as
                     effective user name may change their effective user  name
                     to an arbitrary value. Used, e.g., by "ftpd" and "passwd"

                     effect.

              <B>FGROUP</B> <B>Filesystem</B> <B>access</B> group name. Used  only  in  file-system
                     access. Can be set to any of the current effective, saved
                     or real group names. Processes with "root"  as  effective
                     group  name can set their filesystem access group name to

                     change its effective group name. Any process  may  change
                     its  effective group name to the same value as either its
                     saved or real group name. Only processes with  "root"  as
                     effective  group  name  may  change their effective group
                     name to an arbitrary value. Used,  e.g.,  by  "ftpd"  and

                     effective  group  name  may  change their effective group
                     name to an arbitrary value. Used,  e.g.,  by  "ftpd"  and

              <B>Input</B> <B>format</B>: "C" (a sequence of 26 NULL-terminated strings).
              Accepts, as argument, a NULL-terminated string containing a com-
              mand-line  to  remove  a <I>term</I> from the <I>filter</I> <I>expression</I> used to
              select the processes to be monitored by means of a dedicated DIM
              SVC.
              The  command  to  remove  a certain filter must have <I>exactly</I> the
              same options used before to add the filter iteself. E.g.,  if  a
              filter was added by means of the string "-c *Srv -u *Srv_u" sent
              to the <B>startMonitoring</B> CMD, it can be  removed  by  sending  the
              same string "-c *Srv -u *Srv_u" to the CMD <B>stopMonitoring</B>.
              The  current  <I>filter</I>  <I>expression</I>  can  be viewed by means of the
              ".../monitored/properties" DIM SVC (see above).
